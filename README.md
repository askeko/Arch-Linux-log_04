# An Arch Linux journey, 4rd iteration
Logging the process of my Arch Linux installation. This log is written to help myself and others getting started on Arch Linux. It's written from a perspective of someone who has minimal experience with GNU/Linux in general and is for educational purpose only. It's mainly following the Arch Linux installation guide on the Arch wiki and will not feature lengthy explanations for everything done (you can explore the Arch wiki if you feel like you need more info). It will however feature problems that occur during the installation and hopefully solutions to these.

My goal is to create a working Arch Linux system that I can use while learning to code.

**DISCLAIMER: This is written by someone who is completely new to GNU/Linux and coding**
